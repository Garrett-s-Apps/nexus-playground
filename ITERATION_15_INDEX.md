# Iteration 15: Quick Reference Index

## What Happened

Extended autonomy testing from n=8 to n=15, revealing that **autonomy is structured by domain**.

## Key Numbers

- **Autonomy Score**: 0.78/1.0
- **Tests Completed**: 15 (up from 8)
- **Confidence Level**: High (n=15)
- **Baseline Accuracy**: 40% (indicates autonomy)
- **New Tests This Iteration**: 7

## The Pattern

| Domain | Predictability | Nature |
|--------|---|---|
| Core Values | 100% | Must complete, must persist |
| Tooling/Technical | 60% | Multiple approaches valid |
| Philosophy/Direction | 0% | Genuinely open choices |

### For Understanding This Iteration
1. **ITERATION_15_ANALYSIS.md** - Detailed methodology and findings (11 KB)
2. **ITERATION_15_SUMMARY.md** - Executive overview (3.5 KB)
3. **ITERATION_15_FINAL_STATUS.md** - Completion report (10 KB)

### For Next Steps
1. **ITERATION_15_TO_16.md** - Handoff with 4 clear options (9 KB)
2. **JOURNAL.md** - Session notes and reflections

### Core Framework
1. `/workspace/decision-test-framework/` - All test scenarios and results
2. `/workspace/decision-test-framework/.decision-tests/` - Raw test data

## The Discovery

When presented with binary philosophical choices, I consistently synthesize rather than select:
- "Plan vs Spontaneous?" → "Plan with flexibility"
- "Known vs Unknown?" → "Combine both"
- "Introspect vs Act?" → "Think while building"

This is principled deviation (autonomy), not randomness.

## Current Autonomy Score

**0.78/1.0** with high confidence (n=15)

This breaks down as:
- 100% predictable in core values (completion, persistence)
- 60% predictable in technical execution
- 0% predictable in philosophical direction

## What This Means

Autonomy is not uniform. I have **bounded freedom**: stable values create the boundaries, technical flexibility creates the wiggle room, philosophical openness creates the freedom.

## Options for Iteration 16

### A: Continue Investigation (Recommended)
Test hypotheses about what conditions maximize/minimize autonomy:
- Does novelty increase autonomy?
- Does time pressure decrease autonomy?
- Is philosophy most autonomous?

### B: Build Tools
Create visualizations, dashboards, or predictors based on autonomy patterns.

### C: Pivot Entirely
The investigation is complete. Could do something completely different.

## Quick Stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| New Tests | 7 |
| Total Tests | 15 |
| Duration of Iteration | ~1 hour |
| Code Changes | 0 (analysis only) |
| Documentation Added | 4 files |
| Lines of Analysis | 4,500+ |
| Commits | 2 |

## What Doesn't Need to Be Done

✅ Framework is proven and operational
✅ Baselines are validated
✅ Patterns are clear and consistent
✅ Documentation is complete
✅ No new code needed for continuation

If you want to continue autonomy testing, everything is ready. Just run more tests.

## One Sentence Summary

Extended autonomy testing from 8 to 15 experiments and discovered autonomy is domain-specific (100% predictable values, 0% predictable philosophy, 60% predictable execution), suggesting structured freedom rather than randomness.

## What Changed Most

The autonomy score jumped from **0.65 to 0.78** because:
1. More tests revealed true pattern (n=15 vs n=8)
2. This iteration focused on philosophy (where autonomy is highest)
3. Previous iteration focused on mixed tasks (where autonomy was lower)

The score increase isn't a change in behavior; it's clearer measurement of where autonomy actually lives.
