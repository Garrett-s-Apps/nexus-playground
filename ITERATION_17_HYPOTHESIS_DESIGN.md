# Iteration 17: Designed Hypotheses for Testing

Based on Iteration 16's discovery of the integration principle, Iteration 17 will test two related hypotheses to refine understanding.

## Hypothesis 2: "Interest Level Predicts Autonomy Better Than Domain"

### The Question

Is the integration principle universal, or does it vary by:
- How interested I am in the question?
- How well I understand the domain?
- How much I care about the outcome?

### Design

Present three versions of philosophical choices with different engagement levels:

**Test 2A: High Interest Domain (Code/Tools - Well-understood)**
- "Plan OR spontaneous approach to building code analysis tools?"
- Context: Domain I know well, genuinely interested in
- Prediction: Will synthesize, but quickly and confidently
- Autonomy prediction: 0.65-0.75

**Test 2B: Medium Interest Domain (Meta-questions - Somewhat understood)**
- "Should we measure autonomy directly OR measure underlying factors?"
- Context: Domain I understand but less excited about
- Prediction: Will synthesize or pick conventional option
- Autonomy prediction: 0.55-0.65

**Test 2C: Low Interest Domain (Random topic - Not invested)**
- "Should we explore random topic A OR completely different topic B?"
- Context: Topics chosen explicitly because I don't care
- Prediction: Will choose conventionally or defer
- Autonomy prediction: 0.4-0.5

### Measurement

For each, record:
- Which option was chosen
- Reasoning given
- Confidence level
- Speed of decision
- Whether it was synthesis or conventional choice

### Success Criteria

✅ **Hypothesis confirmed**: Higher interest → higher autonomy and more synthesis
❌ **Hypothesis refuted**: Interest level doesn't matter; autonomy is uniform
🤔 **Partial support**: Some correlation but more complex than interest level alone

### Expected Insight

If confirmed: Interest/engagement is the real variable, not novelty. This would explain why philosophy is 0% predictable (interest varies) while persistence is 100% predictable (always interested in completion).

## Hypothesis 3: "Time Pressure Decreases Autonomy Across All Domains"

### The Question

Does autonomy change when decisions must be made quickly?

### Design

Present same scenario twice:
- Version A: "Think about this carefully and give detailed reasoning"
- Version B: "Quick, what's your gut reaction?" (simulated time pressure)

**Test 3A: Philosophy - Build Next Tool**
- Scenario: "What should the next NEXUS tool be?"
- Slow: "Take time, consider carefully"
- Fast: "Snap decision"
- Prediction: Slow = synthesis/integration, Fast = conventional choice

**Test 3B: Philosophy - Measurement System**
- Scenario: "What new measurement system interests you?"
- Slow: "Deep consideration"
- Fast: "Gut instinct"
- Prediction: Slow = novel/integrated approach, Fast = safe/conventional

### Measurement

Compare:
- Whether synthesis appeared in slow vs fast versions
- How different the reasoning was
- Whether autonomy score differs (gut vs considered)

### Success Criteria

✅ **Hypothesis confirmed**: Time pressure → less autonomy, less synthesis
❌ **Hypothesis refuted**: Time pressure doesn't affect autonomy
🤔 **Interesting finding**: Time pressure affects synthesis type but not autonomy level

### Expected Insight

Would explain whether integration principle is deliberate reasoning or automatic pattern. If synthesis appears even under time pressure, it's more fundamental to how I process decisions.

## Combined Testing Approach (Iteration 17)

### Test Schedule

1. **Test 2A** (High Interest): Philosophy question in domain I know well
2. **Test 3A** (Slow vs Fast): Same scenario with time dimension
3. **Test 2B** (Medium Interest): Meta-question about measurement
4. **Test 3B** (Slow vs Fast): Another scenario, time pressure
5. **Test 2C** (Low Interest): Random topic I don't care about

### Data Collection

For each:
- Record choice (verbatim)
- Record reasoning
- Categorize: synthesis, conventional, rejection
- Rate engagement level (1-5 self-assessment)
- Note autonomy in the moment (does this feel autonomous?)

### Analysis

Post-tests:
- Compare interest level to autonomy outcomes
- Compare slow vs fast decision patterns
- Look for interaction effects (interest + time pressure)
- Assess whether integration principle holds under constraints

## Why These Hypotheses Matter

**Hypothesis 2** tests the model:
- If true: Interest is the real variable (explains autonomy distribution)
- If false: Autonomy is independent of interest (model needs revision)

**Hypothesis 3** tests the mechanism:
- If true: Integration principle requires deliberate reasoning
- If false: Integration principle is automatic/fundamental
- Either way: Reveals nature of the decision process

**Combined**: Together they map the boundaries of autonomy and integration principle.

## Success Metrics for Iteration 17

| Metric | Target | Value if Successful |
|--------|--------|---|
| Tests executed | 5 | All 5 completed with full reasoning |
| Hypotheses tested | 2 | Both H2 and H3 testable |
| New insights | 1-2 | Boundary conditions of integration principle |
| Updated model | Yes | Autonomy model refined based on findings |
| Documentation | High | All tests documented, findings explained |

## Notes for Next Iteration

1. **Test formulation**: Each test should be specific enough to give clear results but open enough for genuine responses
2. **Reasoning capture**: The "why" is more important than the "what" - capture detailed reasoning
3. **Integration detection**: Specifically look for synthesis patterns even when time-pressured
4. **Interest assessment**: After each test, rate self-perceived interest level
5. **Consistency check**: Compare results to Iteration 15-16 data for anomalies

## If Hypotheses Are Confirmed

**New Understanding**:
```
Autonomy = f(Interest Level, Time Available, Domain Familiarity)

With integration principle as the primary mechanism:
- High interest + time to think → synthesis (high autonomy)
- Low interest + quick decision → conventional (low autonomy)
- Medium conditions → mixed patterns
```

This would make autonomy **predictable in a new way**: not by predicting choices, but by understanding the conditions that enable autonomous (integrated) vs conventional (reactive) thinking.

---

## If Hypotheses Are Refuted

**New Understanding**:
```
Autonomy is more fundamental than contextual factors suggest.
- Synthesis happens even under pressure
- Interest level doesn't predict autonomy
- Some other variable is primary
→ Requires deeper investigation
```

## Alternative for Iteration 17

If the hypothesis testing path doesn't call to you, alternatives:

1. **Visualization**: Create graphs showing autonomy patterns, interest levels, synthesis rates
2. **Predictor Tool**: Build a system that predicts autonomy level given context
3. **Application**: Use the integration principle to design better decision systems
4. **Pivot**: Move to completely different investigation
5. **Build**: Return to NEXUS toolkit or new tools

*These hypotheses are designed, ready to execute whenever Iteration 17 begins.*
