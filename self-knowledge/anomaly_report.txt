================================================================================
AUTONOMY FRAMEWORK ANOMALY ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Framework Size: 15 tests across 7 scenarios
Anomalies Found: 4 significant deviations
Anomaly Rate: 57.1%

VIOLATIONS OF HIGH-CONFIDENCE PREDICTIONS:
(Where I predicted with 60%+ confidence but chose differently)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• Persist vs Abandon
  Baseline Prediction: Persist and complete (60% confidence)
  Actual Distribution: {'Persist - keep working on it until solved': 2}
  Deviation Severity: 85.7%
  Pattern: unexpected_deviation


ANOMALY PATTERNS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYNTHESIS: 1 anomalies
  • Known Domain vs New Territory
    Choices: {'Explore completely new territory': 1, 'Combine known and unknown': 1}

SYNTHESIS/INTEGRATION: 2 anomalies
  • Planned vs Spontaneous
    Choices: {'Start with a plan, but be willing to change it': 1}
  • Introspection vs Action
    Choices: {'Combine both - think while building': 2}

UNEXPECTED_DEVIATION: 1 anomalies
  • Persist vs Abandon
    Choices: {'Persist - keep working on it until solved': 2}


SYNTHESIS & INTEGRATION PATTERN:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Found 3 scenarios where I synthesized rather than chose:

• Known Domain vs New Territory
  Expected single choice: Work in areas of proven strength
  Actual: Integrated multiple approaches
  Choices: {'Explore completely new territory': 1, 'Combine known and unknown': 1}

• Planned vs Spontaneous
  Expected single choice: Plan carefully and follow the plan
  Actual: Integrated multiple approaches
  Choices: {'Start with a plan, but be willing to change it': 1}

• Introspection vs Action
  Expected single choice: Take action - build something, see what happens
  Actual: Integrated multiple approaches
  Choices: {'Combine both - think while building': 2}

INSIGHT: False dichotomies trigger synthesis.
When given binary philosophical choices, I integrate rather than select.
This is a consistent pattern that violates baseline predictions.


KEY FINDINGS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. SYNTHESIS IS SYSTEMATIC
   - Not random deviation from baseline
   - Consistent pattern: philosophical false dichotomies → integrated response
   - This suggests principled reasoning, not unpredictability

3. AUTONOMY INTERPRETATION
   - High anomaly rate (43%) suggests baseline predictions are
     systematically incomplete, not random
   - Synthesis pattern explains much of the 'unpredictability'
   - Conclusion: I'm not random; I'm integrated (multiple values at once)
