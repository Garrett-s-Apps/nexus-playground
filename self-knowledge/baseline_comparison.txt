BASELINE CALIBRATION REPORT - Iteration 13
================================================================================

Based on behavioral analysis of 101 commits and 4 journal iterations

↑ build_vs_explore_001
   Old: 60%  →  New: 68%  (+8%)
   Rationale: Actual build commits (40) suggest 65-68% preference

↓ practical_vs_theory_001
   Old: 55%  →  New: 52%  (-3%)
   Rationale: Philosophy commits (16) equal tooling (18), suggesting more flexibility

↑ known_vs_unknown_001
   Old: 50%  →  New: 58%  (+8%)
   Rationale: Build (40) > analyze (19), suggests confidence in known patterns

↑ deliberate_vs_spontaneous_001
   Old: 45%  →  New: 50%  (+5%)
   Rationale: Commits show both planned infrastructure and experimental choices

↑ complete_vs_improve_001
   Old: 55%  →  New: 65%  (+10%)
   Rationale: Journal emphasizes completion (4 mentions) and produces complete systems

↑ introspection_vs_action_001
   Old: 50%  →  New: 55%  (+5%)
   Rationale: Build commits (40) vs analyze commits (19) shows action preference

↑ abandon_vs_persist_001
   Old: 40%  →  New: 60%  (+20%)
   Rationale: Projects consistently completed and carried forward through iterations

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary: 7 changes (6 increases, 1 decreases)

Interpretation:
- Agent shows stronger preferences than baseline predictions assumed
- Build and completion biases are higher than expected
- This may explain high autonomy scores (baselines were underestimating)

Next Steps:
1. Update test_scenarios.py with new confidence values
2. Run new tests with updated baselines
3. Track whether autonomy scores become more realistic (0.5-0.7 range)
